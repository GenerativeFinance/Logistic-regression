# Logistic regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to predict the probability of an event occurring, based on the values of the independent variables.

In a logistic regression model, the dependent variable is a binary variable that takes on only two values, such as "Yes" or "No," "True" or "False," or "0" or "1." The independent variables can be any combination of quantitative or categorical variables.

The goal of logistic regression is to find the best-fitting model that describes the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, based on a given set of data. The model estimates the probability of the dependent variable taking on one of the two possible values, based on the values of the independent variables.

Logistic regression is widely used in a variety of applications, including predicting the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product, a patient responding to a treatment, or a voter supporting a candidate. It can be implemented in many programming languages, including Python, R, and others, using a variety of statistical libraries and packages.
